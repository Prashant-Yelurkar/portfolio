At Vibrt Pvt Ltd, I began my journey into real-time web development by working on several live projects.

This role introduced me to agile workflows and team collaboration, giving me firsthand experience in building digital products from scratch.

One of my key contributions was to an innovative Hearing Aid E-commerce Website, which not only sold hearing devices but also included a feature to calculate users' hearing disability and determine their stage of hearing loss. I worked on implementing user input forms, logic for stage calculation, and seamless front-end interactions to ensure a smooth user experience.

This internship sharpened my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. It also gave me experience with user-centric design and data-driven UI logic. Most importantly, it laid a strong technical and problem-solving foundation that I’ve built upon throughout my development career.`,
